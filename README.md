<br>Co-Authored by Keivan Matinzadeh

**Requirements:**
* JDK Version 1.8
* Gradle 2.14.1
* An Android Emulator or Phone

**Setup:**
1) Open your favourite terminal.
2) Run `gradle build` in the source folder of this downloaded repository.
3) Navigate to `[source folder]/android/build/outputs/apk/`.
4) You can now run `android-debug.apk` on your emulator or on your phone. (Assuming you allow installations from unknown sources.)

**Development Setup:**
1) Head into `[source folder]/core/src/com/mygdx/indagame/`
2) The relevant code can be found in `ÃŒnDaGame.java` and in the screens directory

Note:<br>
I take no responsibility if anything happens to your phone should you run this application on it. 
This is old code and I do not intend to revisit it.
